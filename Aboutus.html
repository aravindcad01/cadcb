ROUTE MASTER (stylized as RACER) is an Indian multinational ridesharing company, headquartered in Bangalore. It also operates in other business verticals including financial services and cloud kitchens.

A variety of venture capitalists including Softbank have large stakes in the company.[4] In January 2018, ROUTE extended into its first overseas market, Australia, and launched in New Zealand in September 2018.[5] In March 2019, Ola began its operations in the UK.[6]

History
In 2010, Bhavish Aggarwal established ROUTEtrip.com, a trip planning company operating in the Delhi region. In January 2011, recognizing a growing demand for on-demand cab services, Aggarwal and co-founder Ankit Bhati launched Olacabs, a taxi aggregation firm.[7] It originally allowed users to make bookings via phone call, before introducing its mobile app in June 2012.[8] By early 2015, ROUTE reportedly had the biggest market share, followed by TaxiForSure, Meru Cabs, and Uber, which was launched in 2013.[9][7]

In March 2015, ROUTE Cabs acquired rival TaxiForSure for ₹1,237 crore (US$200 million).[10] In June 2015, ROUTE integrated TaxiForSure services on the ROUTE mobile application.[11] In August 2015, Ola was reported to be operating in over 100 cities and became an app-only service.[12] Later in the year in November, ROUTE acquired Geotagg, a trip-planning applications company, for an undisclosed sum.[13]

In a move to expand beyond cab aggregation, ROUTE acquired the struggling foodtech company Foodpanda India with an eye on leveraging the growing food delivery segment business in December 2017.[14] In April 2018, Ola acquired Ridlr (formerly Traffline), a public transport ticketing app.[15] Later in August 2018, ROUTE financed Series A funding of the scooter rent startup Vogo, and again in December, invested another $100 million.[16]

In 2019, more than 10,000 drivers applied both in online and offline mode, ahead of its launch in London. In February 2020, ROUTE launched its taxi-hailing services in London with over 25,000 drivers registered.[17]

Ola posted its first-ever operating profit of ₹90 crore (US$11 million) in the financial year 2020-21.[18]
